## Game Definition

In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points.
On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for
the turn is the sum of dice outcomes.

Special rules:

* **Pig Out.** If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 0.
* **Piggy Back.** When the current player scores 0, the opposing player recieves points equal
	to the number of dice rolled that turn.
	* *Example:* If the current player rolls 3 dice that come up 1, 5, 1, then the current player
		scores 0 and the opponent scores 3. 
* **Free Bacon.** A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more than the largest digit in the 
opponent's total score. 
	* *Example 1:* If the opponent has 42 points, the current player gains 1 + max(4, 2) = 5 points 
	by rolling zero dice.
	* *Example 2:* If the opponent has 48 points, the current player gains 1 + max(4, 8) = 9 points by 
	rolling zero dice. 
	* *Example 3:* If the opponent has 7 points, the current player gains 1 + max(0, 7) = 8 points by
	rolling zero dice. 
* **Hog Wild.** If the sum of both players' total scores is a multiple of seven (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then 
the current player rolls 4-sided dice instead of the usual six-sided dice. 
* **Hogtimus Prime.** If a player's score for the turn is a prime number, then the turn score is 
increased to the next largest prime number. For example, if the dice outcomes sum to 19, the current 
player scores 23 points for the turn. This boost only applies to the current player. *Note:* 1 is not 
a prime number!
* **Swine Swap.** After the turn score is added, if the last two digits of each player's score are the 
reverse of each other, the players swap total scores. 
	* *Example 1:* The current player has a total score of 13 and the opponent has 91. The current 
	player rolls two dice that total 6. The last two digits of the current player's new total score(19) 
	are the reverse of the opponent's score (91). These scores are swapped! The current player now has 
	91 points and the opponent has 19. The turn ends. 
	* *Example 2:* The current player has 66 and the opponent has 8. The current player rolls dice that 
	total 14, leaving the current player with 80. The reverse of 80 is 08, the opponent's score. After 
	the swap the current player has 8 and the opponent has 80. The turn ends. 
	* *Example 3:* Both players have 90. The current player rolls 7 dice that total 17, a prime that is 
	boosted to 19 points for the turn. The current player has 109 and the opponent has 90. The last 
	two digits 09 and 90 are the reverse of each other, so the scores are swapped. The opponent ends the 
	turn with 109 and wins the game.

## Solve:

This problem is recognizable as an Expectimax Tree. Simply put, an expectimax tree is consisted of state 
nodes and action nodes. The tree is rooted at a state node indicating the scores for both players at 
zero and zero, as well as who is about to play. Each state either offers a set of possible action 
nodes or evaluates to a discrete number of points which represents the number of points expected 
(but not guaranteed) should a user reach that state. Each action node has a value equal to the 
following summation:





Subsequently, each state node can also be quantized as a value, which would be equal to the following 
equation:


Or, if one prefers a solve with DP:

Here's my logical deduction on how a final strategy can be developered:
1. First, we recognize that given a score and opponent's score, there exists an optimal number of 
rolls. In other words, a best strategy exists for every score and opponent score.
	1. In theory you could devise a 100x100 matrix and try every single combination of 0-10 in each
	of the elements and see which configuration gives the highest avg score. However there are 11^10k
	combinations, which is too many to solve for...
2. The best number of rolls must be the number of rolls that maximizes our chance of winning;
this is the definition of the best number of rolls.
3. Given 1 and 2, there must be a function such that, given score, opponent's score, and number of dice 
to roll (k), it returns the probability of winning by rolling k number of dice.
4.
